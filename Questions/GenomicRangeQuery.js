// Question:
//////////////////////////////////////////////////
/*
/**
 * A DNA sequence can be represented as a string consisting of the letters A, C, G and T,
 * which correspond to the types of successive nucleotides in the sequence. Each nucleotide
 * has an impact factor, which is an integer. Nucleotides of types A, C, G and T have impact
 * factors of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. You are going to answer several queries of the form:
 * What is the minimal impact factor of nucleotides contained in a particular part of the given DNA sequence?
 *
 * The DNA sequence is given as a non-empty string S = S[0]S[1]...S[N-1] consisting of N characters.
 * There are M queries, which are given in non-empty arrays P and Q, each consisting of M integers.
 * The K-th query (0 â‰¤ K < M) requires you to find the minimal impact factor of nucleotides contained
 * in the DNA sequence between positions P[K] and Q[K] (inclusive).
 *
 * Approach:
 * for each range find occurence of A,C,G,T char in range and return corresponding value

//PSUEDOCODE:

declare an object to map
declare a short string for checking values LOWEST impactFactor to highest.

Iterate through Queries...
On each query, ask if the current slice contains the FIRST ---> LAST index of the sub string AGCT
Break on the lowest available...
